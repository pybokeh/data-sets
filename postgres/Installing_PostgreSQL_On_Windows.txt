Installing Postgres on Windows with Zip Archive (when you don't have admin rights to your machine)

Download zip archive: https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries

1) Extract zip

2) Create "data" folder in your root PostgreSQL installation folder

3) Then issue the following command while in bin folder: initdb -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -D %USERPROFILE%\apps\PostgreSQL15\data --auth=trust

4) Create "start_postgres.bat" file with the following contents:
@ECHO ON
@SET PATH="%~dp0\bin";%PATH%
@SET PGDATA=%~dp0\data
@SET PGDATABASE=postgres
@SET PGUSER=postgres
@SET PGPORT=5439
@SET PGLOCALEDIR=%~dp0\share\locale
initdb -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -D "%PGDATA%" --auth=trust
"%~dp0\bin\pg_ctl" -D "%PGDATA%" -o "-p %PGPORT%" -l logfile start
pause

Then save "start_postgres.bat" in the root PostgreSQL installation folder.  Run this batch file once, the exit out of it.
Then comment out the line containing the initdb command by placing REM in front of it.  We run the initdb once and only once!
NOTE: This sets up your PostgreSQL server to be accessible from only your local machine.  To configure your PostgreSQL server
otherwise, is beyond the scope of this batch file.

5) Create "stop_postgres.bat" file with the following contents:
@ECHO ON
REM Shutting down the PostgreSQL server...
"%~dp0\bin\pg_ctl" stop -D "%~dp0\data"
pause

Then save "stop_postgres.bat" in the root PostgreSQL installation folder.  This will properly shut down your PostgreSQL server.
