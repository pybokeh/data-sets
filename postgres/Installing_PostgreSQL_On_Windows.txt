Installing Postgres on Windows with Zip Archive (when you don't have admin rights to your machine)

Download zip archive: https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries

1) Extract zip

2) Create "data" folder in your root PostgreSQL installation folder

3) Create "start_postgres.bat" file with the following contents:
@ECHO ON
@SET PATH="%~dp0\bin";%PATH%
@SET PGDATA=%~dp0\data
@SET PGDATABASE=postgres
@SET PGUSER=postgres
@SET PGPORT=5439
@SET PGLOCALEDIR=%~dp0\share\locale
initdb -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -D "%PGDATA%" --auth=trust
"%~dp0\bin\pg_ctl" -D "%PGDATA%" -o "-p %PGPORT%" -l logfile start
pause

Then save "start_postgres.bat" in the root PostgreSQL installation folder.  Run this .bat/batch file once, then exit out of it.
Then edit "start_postgres.bat" by placing REM at the start of the line containing the initdb command - this prevents initdb from executing again.
Then from now on, run this batch file to start your PostgreSQL server without executing initdb.  You can add it to your Windows "Start Up" or run
it manually.  To add this batch file to Startup, see this article: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000322.htm

NOTE: This sets up your PostgreSQL server to be accessible from only your local machine.  To configure your PostgreSQL server
otherwise, is beyond the scope of this batch file.

5) Create "stop_postgres.bat" file with the following contents:
@ECHO ON
REM Shutting down the PostgreSQL server...
"%~dp0\bin\pg_ctl" stop -D "%~dp0\data"
pause

Then save "stop_postgres.bat" in the root PostgreSQL installation folder.  This will properly shut down your PostgreSQL server.
