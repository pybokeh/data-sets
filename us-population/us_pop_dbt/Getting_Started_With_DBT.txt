# Install dbt-core and the necessary libraries for the backend you are using
pip install dbt-core<br>
pip install dbt-[your_backend]<br>
For example: pip install dbt-snowflake or pip install dbt-postgres

 
# Create profiles.yml file
Create .dbt folder at ~/.dbt, then create profiles.yml file inside this folder

Populate profiles.yml file based on the backend technology you are using<br>
If using Snowflake:<br>
https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/snowflake-setup

or visit: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/about-core-connections<br>
for other backends


# Check dbt is installed correctly
Check dbt is installed correctly by issuing the following command: `dbt --version`

 
# Create new dbt project
Navigate to folder location you want to create your new dbt project, then issue the following command: `dbt init`
  - Enter the project's name
  - CTRL + C to exit when it prompts you to enter number for backend to use

 
After executing the dbt init command, it should have created a new folder with the name that you provided and bunch of
other folders and files inside this new folder.

 

# Set up your dbt project to work with your backend
**VERY IMPORTANT**<br>
Edit the dbt_project.yml and where it says:<br>
profile: 'your_profile'<br>
You change 'your_profile' to match the profile name in your profiles.yml that you created in the earlier step.

 
# Check that dbt is set up correctly to work with your backend
Make sure you are in the same directory that contains the dbt_project.yml file.  If so, then issue the following command:<br>

`dbt debug`

This should perform checks to make sure everything is setup right, that it can connect to your backend.
If all checks passed, then you are all set!
